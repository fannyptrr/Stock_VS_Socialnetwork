# Stock_VS_Socialnetwork

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Objective of this project is to link the stock status of a product with our image bank and then our social network.
The idea, due to lack of staff, is to simplify the community manager role. Every 2 weeks, the process create a stock status per product, he select 2 main product in stock and then he go on the image bank to find picture of the product, modify it and promote and post-it on our social network.

## Background

This idea will alleviate the problem of irrelevant corporate communications and improve the pertinence of communication. It will generate a regular post on our social network who promote the product with the more stock. In parrallel the community manager can work on other contents. 
This problem is really constant currently.
I'm in charge of social network so it will help myself on my job.
This topic can at the end, help a lot of compagny on their strategy of social media and editorial line planification.

## How is it used?

The solution will use unsupervised learning and deep learning to select the products with the highest stock levels (based on internal data which will include current and pending orders). Then, after selecting the products, the process will fetch an image of the product from the image bank (sorted by product name), which it will modify if the quality is average, before publishing it on social networks. Users will be companies who don't have the time to perform this analysis manually, and who want to be present on social networks on a regular basis. 

## Data sources and AI methods

Data will be collected internally by our process of managing stock. Image bank is also generate by ourself.

## Challenges

The limit could be the capacity to post the publication on our social network, I don't exactly no how it could be made.

## What next?

Now i need to find someone who could help me on that project. In term of finalization of the process and code.
